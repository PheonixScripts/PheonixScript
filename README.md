Skyblock-Gemstone-Macro A skyblock gemstone macro I custom made. I combined Pizza Client's gemstone nuker with Baritone's incredible pathfinding in order to create an efficent gemstone macro.  Contains all regular baritone commands as well as custom macro commands.  Modified Baritone's movements to be more smooth and added some randomization to the movements in order to bypass watchdog.  Custom commands:  #config  opens a config menu, mainly meant to change settings and failsafes #gemstone on/off  pathfinds to and mines all nearby gemstones #gemstone (gem type) on/off  pathfinds to and mines the specific gemstone type #powder  mines nearby hardstone and automatically opens treasure chests Baritones base settings are already customized.  There are many failsafes that can be changed within #config menu. The macro can leave when people are nearby, it can avoid open areas to lower chances of being seen, etc. It also can bypass some macro checks, however skyblock staff really dont target gemstone macroing at all because its not high priority.
